# Node workshop
For all work, start with installing the [Node.js runtime](https://nodejs.org).

To run your program go to the directory where your ```.js``` file is located
and run
```
node *yourfile*.js
```

### JavaScript

If you have trouble with JavaScript there are two ways I usually find my answer.  
Either by googling with the ```mdn``` keyword (Mozilla Developer Network)  
Example: [array concat mdn](https://www.google.se/search?q=concat+array+mdn&oq=concat+array+mdn&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l3j69i60.2327j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)  
or just googling with the keyword ```node``` or ```javascript``` depending on what kind if issue you are having.  
Usually there are very good StackOverflow answers to any questions you might have.

If it's node related, the node documentation is a very good place to start.

Here are some suggested things you can build

### Test the command line! (Basic)

### Command line tool (Easy)
