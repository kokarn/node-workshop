# Node workshop
For all work, start with installing the [Node.js runtime](https://nodejs.org).

To run your program go to the directory where your ```.js``` file is located
and run
```
node *yourfile*.js
```

Here are some suggested things you can build

### Test the command line! (Basic)
Build a simple script that repeats your name.

[name](./name/NAME.md)

### REST service (Easy)
Build a basic REST API.

[REST](./rest/REST.md)

### Command line tool (Easy)
Build a command line tool that packages a directory specified by an argument.

[Command line tool](./cli/CLI.md)

### Task runner (Advanced)
Use a task runner and set it up so it uses ESLint to lint your program everytime you change it.

[Task runner](./task/TASK.md)


### Desktop application (hard)
A desktop application that displays the current time with Electron.

[Desktop](./electron/ELECTRON.md)
