## Task runner
Use a task runner and set it up so it uses ESLint to lint your program everytime you change it.

Both [grunt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt) and [gulp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp) are very good when it comes to running tasks.

Both of them have plugins that support ESLint and setting up the listeners should be pretty straightforward.
